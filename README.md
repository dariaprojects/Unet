Segmentation of computed tomography images of the lungs.
This project was created as part of a master's thesis. The model was trained on data from the Kaggle environment.  
The accuracy of the allocation of the affected area of the lungs using this model is 90 percent.

For the model to work, the Pytorch framework and data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maedemaftouni/covid19-ct-scan-lesion-segmentation-dataset.
